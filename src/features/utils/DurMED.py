        Computes the median silence duration from a voice sample.
        This function processes a voice sample from a given folder path, segments it
        using specified window parameters, and calculates the silence durations. It
        then returns the median of these silence durations.
        Parameters:
            folder_path (str): The path to the folder containing the voice sample in WAV format.
            winlen (int, optional): The length of the analysis window. Default is 512.
            winover (int, optional): The overlap between consecutive windows. Default is 496.
            wintype (str, optional): The type of window function to apply (e.g., 'hamm' for Hamming window). Default is 'hamm'.
        Returns:
            float: The median duration of silence segments in the voice sample, in seconds.
